# Blocksky

A huge list of Bsky profiles whose posts you would rather not see. They are all bots, or filled with misanthropic, anti-queer, anti-religious, or other inappropriate content.

> This repository is WIP

## Why?

My belief is that Bluesky should remain a non-toxic platform where everyone feels welcome and comfortable. Therefore, everyone should have the opportunity to use it without encountering hate speech, toxic users, misanthropic opinions, transphobia, and other disturbing content.

The goal of Blocksky is to provide as many unpleasant accounts as possible for everyone in a moderation list that can be easily subscribed to.

## How?

In addition to adding accounts to this list myself, various trustworthy moderation lists are also retrieved daily and the accounts contained therein are entered into Blocksky. Here is a list of the lists currently in use:

## Contributing

Anyone who wants to contribute is more than welcome to do so. There are two options:

### 1. Share good moderation lists

> So far, Blocksky is mainly designed for English and German accounts. It would be great if as many languages â€‹â€‹as possible could be covered.

The easiest option would be to provide good moderation lists via GitHub issues. This can of course be one you have created yourself, but also one created by another user. Of course, you can also write me a message on Bluesky and tell me the moderation lists there.

### 2. Code contributions

As in any other GitHub repo, you can of course improve the code or add features. All you have to do is open a pull request and I will look at the changes as soon as possible. However, it is necessary to adhere to the [license](https://github.com/nandolawson/Blocksky/blob/main/LICENSE).
